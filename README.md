# getCleanData
Final course project for Getting and Cleaning Data
Source of Data: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Requirements: 
1. a tidy data set 
2. a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis
3. a code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations/work performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md).

This README.md file explains how the scripts work and how they are connected.
